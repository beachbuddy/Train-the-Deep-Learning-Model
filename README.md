# Train-the-Deep-Learning-Model

In this milestone, you learn how to train the deep learning model that you defined in Milestone 1 of this liveProject. The callbacks that you defined in Milestone 1 will be the key to controlling the training process and ensuring that you get maximum benefit from the time and machine resources that you invest in the training process.
In this milestone you define and run a series of experiments to explore the training characteristics of your model and learn how you can improve its performance, including
Basic experiments to exercise the training process and ensure that you donâ€™t have any functional issues.
Incremental experiments that build up, step by step, an efficient training approach. By iterating through a series of these experiments, you will be able to observe the impact of each adjustment between experiments and develop an intuition about the overall training process.
You will also learn about the tools that you can use to visualize the performance of a trained model, including the matplotlib.pyplot Python API and the TensorBoard utility.
In this milestone, you will adapt and run through the notebook that you created in milestone 1 of this liveProject
